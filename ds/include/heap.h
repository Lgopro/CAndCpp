Name: HeapCreate
Description: Creates a new, empty heap.
Arguments: A compare function, which should return a negative integer if the first argument is less than the second,

Return: A pointer to the newly created heap.
Time complexity: O(1)

Name: HeapPush
Description: Inserts a new element into the heap, maintaining the heap property.
Arguments: A valid pointer to the heap, a pointer to the element to be inserted.
